# One Light For Three Seconds

üß† In this game, players must navigate through intricate mazes with a limited time frame to reach the exit. The catch? You only have a mere 3 seconds to memorize the maze layout before attempting to guide your player through it.

üéÆ After the brief memorization phase, the maze disappears, and the player must guide their character to the exit using arrow keys for ‚óÄÔ∏è left, ‚ñ∂Ô∏è right , üîº up, and üîΩ down movements.

üí™ The challenge lies in recalling the maze's layout from memory and making swift decisions to avoid obstacles and reach the exit before time runs out.
